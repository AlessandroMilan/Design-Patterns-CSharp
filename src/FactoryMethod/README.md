# Factory Method Design Pattern

## Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

## Problem
A framework needs to standardize the architectural model for a range of applications, but allow for individual applications to define their own domain objects and provide for their instantiation.
